            Coirei is designed so that execution happens inside controlled

            Any data that leaves your execution environment does so
            intentionally, securely, and with purpose. We do not believe in
            hidden data collection or opaque AI behaviour. Every system

          How Coirei Works
        </h3>
        <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-white leading-relaxed">
          Coirei operates as a cloud-native execution platform. Code is written
          and executed inside isolated cloud workspaces. Execution environments
          are consistent and reproducible.
        </p>
      </div>

          Cloud-based Capabilities
        </h3>
        <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-white mb-2.5">
          Some Coirei features rely on cloud services to function correctly,
          including:
        </p>
        <ul className="text-base md:text-lg text-white space-y-2 list-disc list-inside">
          <li>Cloud workspaces and execution environments</li>
          <li>Continuous testing and CI/CD orchestration</li>
          <li>AI-assisted analysis and recommendations</li>
          <li>Collaboration, monitoring, and execution history</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-2.5 text-base md:text-lg text-white leading-relaxed">
          All cloud-based data is encrypted in transit and at rest. You can
          delete project data at any time based on your access level and
          organization policies.

          Coirei AI provides execution-aware assistance across planning, code,

        <p className="mt-5 text-base md:text-lg text-white leading-relaxed">
          It helps teams by understanding intent, analyzing execution signals,
          detecting risks, and generating recommendations to improve quality and
          reliability.

        <p className="mt-5 text-base md:text-lg text-white leading-relaxed">
          Some AI capabilities may process execution context such as code diffs,
          test results, workflow state, or system outputs to provide accurate
          assistance. This processing happens strictly within defined boundaries
          and never results in autonomous execution of irreversible actions. All
          critical actions require explicit human approval, and AI behavior is
          always observable and auditable.

        <p className="mt-5 text-base md:text-lg text-white leading-relaxed">
